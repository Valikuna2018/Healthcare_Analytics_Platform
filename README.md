## Problem Statement

Breast cancer is a serious disease and early detection is very important.  
The goal of this project is to use machine learning to predict if a tumor is malignant (cancer) or benign (not cancer) based on medical measurements.

## Dataset Description

This project uses the **Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset** from `scikit-learn`.

The dataset contains:

- 569 samples (patients)
- 30 numerical features (tumor measurements)
- 1 target column:
  - 0 = malignant
  - 1 = benign
